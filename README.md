## Installation  
  ### System Requirements
  
  * #### Windows 10, Windows 11
  * #### 1920 x 1080 resolution (1080p)
  
  We currently do not support Mac or Linux as our testing for those devices is limited.  
  
  As of upcoming patch 14.4 in League of Legends, Riot Games has made the decision to stop supporting Windows 7, 8, and 8.1, meaning a Windows installation of 10 or later is required to play. If you do not have those installed we recommend getting a device or license key that has those versions of Windows as soon as you can.

  Currently our tool only supports 1920 x 1080 resolution. If your monitor supports 1920 x 1080 resolution we recommend switching resolutions before using the Augment Overlay tool, otherwise the tool may not function correctly.

## Frequently Asked Questions
 - **Is the Teamfight Tactics Augment Overlay tool allowed in TFT?**


    TLDR: Yes  
   

    Here is Mortdog, the lead game designer of TFT, presenting Riot's take on overlays: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoIueRc8IqQ&ab_channel=Mortdog-TFT).
   
    Since our tool is basically a mirror of [tactics.tools/augments](https://tactics.tools/augments) it is no different than looking up stats on the [tactics.tools/augments](https://tactics.tools/augments) after looking up augment names by yourself during the game, which is allowed. Since these stats are available to all individuals before the game it does not violate Riot TOS, thus our Teamfight Tactics Augment Overlay tools does not provide any unfair advantage to any players more than tactics.tools/augments does.

   Our tool only displays average placement stats from Diamond+ per augment and does not convince the player in any way, shape, or form to choose the augment with the highest average placement stat or any other augment. Our tool is meant to be merely be a reference for displaying stats and replace having to manually search for average augment placements on tactics.tools/augments during the game.
    
 - **Will I get banned for using the Teamfight Tactics Augment Overlay tool?**
   

   TLDR: Patch 14.3: No. Patch 14.4: We don't know.  


   Patch 14.3 - overlays and tools are allowed in TFT. In addition, we have been testing for 2 weeks with this tool and our account has not been banned or flagged.  

   Patch 14.4 - Riot is releasing Vanguard, their kernel anti-cheat, to the League of Legends Client and thus Teamfight Tactics this patch. Although our tool does not interact with in-game files at all, we are unsure of whether Vanguard will flag it as a cheat or not, and thus we do not know. We are not liable or responsible for any damages or suspensions placed on Riot Accounts using our Teamfight Tactics Augment Overlay tool if it is flagged by Vanguard during TFT games when Vanguard is released.
