## Patch Notes

[Upcoming] 14.4 - DISCLAIMER  

Riot is releasing Vanguard, their kernel anti-cheat, to the League of Legends Client and thus Teamfight Tactics this patch.  

Although our tool does not interact with in-game files at all, we are unsure of whether Vanguard will flag it as a cheat or not. **Please allow us to test whether the tool works with Vanguard**. We are not responsible or liable for any account suspensions or damages involving our Teamfight Tactics Augment Overlay tool if it is flagged by Vanguard.

14.3 - The Teamfight Tactics Augment Overlay tool is working as intended with some minor issues.
